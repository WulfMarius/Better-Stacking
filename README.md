Better-Stacking


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It reduces inventory clutter by changing which items can be stacked and how certains items are stacked.


Items that will be stacked when they have a matching condition:

* Arrow
* Can Opener
* Sewing Kit
* Simple and Quality Tools
* Prybar
* Hacksaw
* Hammer
* Flares


Items that will be stacked even if their condition does not match.  
The condition of the resulting stack will be the overall condition of all items in the stack:

* Accelerant
* Matches
* Pelts


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
