Better-Stacking


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It reduces inventory clutter by changing which items can be stacked and how certain items are stacked.


> **Warning:**  
> Uninstalling this mod while there are still stacked items (from the list below) will result in **losing those items**, as their stack size will be reset to 1 after loading the game.  
> This applies to all items in the inventory and all containers (cupboards, trunks, etc.).  
> Dropping items on the floor or creating stacks with only one item should be safe.  



Items that will be stacked when they have a matching condition:

* Can Openers
* Flares
* Sewing Kits
* Simple and Quality Tools
* Prybars
* Hacksaws
* Hammers
* Knives (including improvised)
* Hatchets (including improvised)



Items that will be stacked even if their condition does not match.  
The condition of the resulting stack will be the overall condition of all items in the stack:

* Accelerant
* Matches
* Dried Pelts
* Dried Saplings



Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
