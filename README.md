Better-Stacking


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It reduces inventory clutter by changing which items can be stacked and how certain items are stacked.


Items that will be stacked when they have a matching condition:

* Can Openers
* Flares
* Sewing Kits
* Simple and Quality Tools
* Prybars
* Hacksaws
* Hammers
* Knives (including improvised)
* Hatchets (including improvised)



Items that will be stacked even if their condition does not match.  
The condition of the resulting stack will be the overall condition of all items in the stack:

* Accelerant
* Matches
* Dried Pelts
* Dried Saplings


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
